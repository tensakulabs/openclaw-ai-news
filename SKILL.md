# AI News Skill

Fetch and summarize AI industry news from curated RSS feeds. Designed to catch major model releases (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, GLM, etc.) and important AI news.

## Usage

Invoke with `/ai-news` or ask for "AI news", "morning briefing", "what's new in AI".

## Feeds

This skill fetches from 10 curated sources:

**Aggregators** (daily/weekly digests):
- TLDR AI — Daily AI industry digest
- Hacker News — Breaking tech news
- The Decoder — AI-focused site
- Last Week in AI — Weekly roundup
- Marktechpost — Research coverage

**Lab Blogs** (via [Olshansk/rss-feeds](https://github.com/Olshansk/rss-feeds)):
- Anthropic News — Claude releases
- OpenAI Research — GPT releases
- xAI News — Grok releases
- Google AI — Gemini/DeepMind
- Claude Code Changelog — CLI updates

## Instructions

### Step 1: Load Feed Configuration

Read the feed list from `feeds.json` in this skill directory.

### Step 2: Fetch Feeds (Parallel)

For each feed in `feeds.aggregators` and `feeds.labs`, use `web_fetch` to retrieve the RSS content:

```
web_fetch(url: "<feed_url>", extractMode: "text")
```

Fetch priority 1 feeds first, then priority 2.

### Step 3: Parse RSS Items

RSS feeds are XML. Extract items using these patterns:

```
<item>
  <title>...</title>
  <link>...</link>
  <pubDate>...</pubDate>
  <description>...</description>
</item>
```

For Atom feeds:
```
<entry>
  <title>...</title>
  <link href="..."/>
  <published>...</published>
  <summary>...</summary>
</entry>
```

### Step 4: Filter by Date

Default: Last 24 hours for daily briefings.
Weekly mode: Last 7 days.

Parse `pubDate`/`published` and filter to recent items only.

### Step 5: Deduplicate

Same story may appear in multiple feeds. Dedupe by:
1. Exact title match
2. Similar title (>80% overlap)
3. Same link URL

Keep the version from the highest-priority source.

### Step 6: Categorize

Assign each item to a category:

| Category | Keywords |
|----------|----------|
| Model Releases | "release", "launch", "announce", model names (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, GLM, Llama) |
| Research | "paper", "research", "study", "benchmark" |
| Industry | "funding", "acquisition", "hire", "layoff", "IPO" |
| Product | "feature", "update", "API", "pricing" |
| Opinion | "think", "believe", "future", "prediction" |

### Step 7: Format Output

```markdown
# AI News Briefing
**Date:** [today's date]
**Sources:** [count] feeds checked
**Period:** Last 24 hours

---

## Model Releases
1. **[Title]** — [1 sentence summary]. [Source]
2. ...

## Research
1. **[Title]** — [1 sentence summary]. [Source]
...

## Industry News
1. **[Title]** — [1 sentence summary]. [Source]
...

---

**Coverage Gap:** Chinese AI labs (Zhipu, DeepSeek, Baidu, Alibaba) don't publish RSS. Check manually for major releases.
```

### Step 8: Handle Errors

If a feed fails to fetch:
- Log the error
- Continue with remaining feeds
- Note failed sources in output

## Cron Integration (OpenClaw)

Add to `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` for automatic morning briefings:

```json
{
  "name": "Morning AI Briefing",
  "schedule": { "kind": "cron", "expr": "0 7 * * *", "tz": "America/Los_Angeles" },
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Run /ai-news and summarize the top 10 most important items."
  },
  "delivery": {
    "mode": "announce",
    "channel": "telegram",
    "to": "YOUR_CHAT_ID"
  }
}
```

## Customization

Edit `feeds.json` to:
- Add/remove feeds
- Change priorities
- Enable optional feeds
